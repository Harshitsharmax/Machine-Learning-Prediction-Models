# ML Prediction Models Repository

Welcome to the ML Prediction Models Repository! This repository houses a collection of simple machine learning prediction models implemented in Python using popular algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and XGBoost Regressor.

## Overview

This repository is a curated collection of basic machine learning prediction models designed for educational and demonstration purposes. Each model is implemented using a straightforward approach to showcase the application of different algorithms in solving predictive tasks.

## ML Models Included

1. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
2. Logistic Regression
3. XGBoost Regressor

## Prediction Models Overview

1. **BigMart Sales Prediction**
   - Predicts the sales of products in BigMart stores based on various features such as item weight, item visibility, item type, and outlet details.

2. **Boston House Price Prediction**
   - Predicts house prices in Boston based on features like crime rate, number of rooms, distance to employment centers, and more.

3. **Breast Cancer Prediction**
   - Predicts whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on features extracted from images of breast tissue.

4. **Calories Burnt Prediction**
   - Predicts the number of calories burnt during physical activities based on features such as age, gender, duration of activity, and heart rate.

5. **Diabetes Prediction**
   - Predicts whether a patient has diabetes based on medical diagnostic measures such as blood pressure, insulin level, BMI, and age.

6. **Heart Disease Prediction**
   - Predicts the presence of heart disease in patients based on features such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.

7. **Home Loan Prediction**
   - Predicts whether a loan application will be approved based on the applicant's details such as income, loan amount, credit history, and property area.

8. **Rock vs. Mine Prediction**
   - Classifies sonar signals as either rocks or mines (submarine objects) based on the energy of the signal at different frequencies.

9. **Spam Mail Prediction**
   - Classifies emails as spam or not spam based on the content and metadata of the emails.
